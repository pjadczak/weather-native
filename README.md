# Welcome to Native Weather
The application is written in **React Native** in **TypeScript**. Application state is in **React Redux**. The data needed for the application is taken from the Visual [Crossing weather](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) service. Location data is taken from [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/). For the application to work properly, you should set the keys to these services in the .env file. This file should be created right after downloading the sources, you can copy the .env_example file and complete the data there.

If you want to contact us regarding the application, please visit the website [www.h15.pl](https://h15.pl). Happy use, if you have any comments, feel free to comment.
